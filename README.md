## BuildCounter 2.0
A useful tool for counting builds throughout development, as well as creating changelogs without having to go through hundreds of commit messages. This will assist with changelogs also. 

### Framework
This is a .NET 6 Windows Presentation Foundation project written in C# 9. The idea is to keep dependencies to a minimum, and make sure that we are using NuGet dependencies where possible to ensure a frustration-free collaberation experience. 

### Development
This project is currently **unfinished** and will be in development for some time yet. Here's a list of the features I plan to add:
- [ ] Ability to manage multiple projects
- [ ] Ability to add changelogs for each build, to "compile a finished changelog" when it comes to publishing the build.

### Contribution
I welcome contributions. Please make sure to keep in touch via [my Discord server](https://maxplayledev.org/discord) so we can collaberate on changes. Be sure to keep to these general guidelines
- Code should be of a consistent quality, and should follow the Syntax Conventions of C#.
- Please follow the conventions of the existing files in the project, using instantiated code where practical.
